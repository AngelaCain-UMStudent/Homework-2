I believe that most people have different combinations of learning styles, as I find it rare for a person to be only a tactile learner, a visual learner, or an auditory learner. 
I also believe that there are numerous other ways to be tactile/visual/auditory learners, as the learning style quiz often proposed outdated questions such as "Do you learn by wrtiting?" or "Do you learn by tactile ways?", and I believe tactile learners can rely on audio and visual tatctiles to learn, and vice versa with audio/visual learners. Personally, I also believe that my learning styles are based off of my neurodivergence, as I will need all three learning styles when learning a new skill/concept. For example, I feel like I learn better by writing/typing concepts, but will need to hear specific music/speaking in order to retain the information.
